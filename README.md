## About

Pilot is an Instagram automation and deal management platform designed to help creators, entrepreneurs, small businesses, and social media managers turn Instagram conversations into qualified pipeline.

Pilot is positioned as a **sales system, not a bot**:

- Intent-aware conversation handling over rigid decision trees
- CRM depth (lead score, stage, sentiment, tags, notes, follow-up context)
- Human Response Needed (HRN) guardrails for risky threads
- Open source and self-hostable for data and platform control

The AI-powered Sidekick supports lead qualification, response generation, and next-step recommendations while preserving human oversight where needed.

## Pilot vs ManyChat

### Common ManyChat pain points

- Unreliable follow-to-DM behavior and delayed sends
- Shadow-ban/account-risk anxiety from aggressive automation patterns
- Per-contact pricing shock as contact count scales
- Flow-builder complexity for simple use cases

### Head-to-head comparison

| Dimension | ManyChat | Pilot | Advantage |
|-----------|----------|-------|-----------|
| **AI Intelligence** | Basic rule-based flows + AI add-on ($) | Native AI-first with intent detection, sentiment analysis, lead scoring | **Pilot** |
| **Conversation Handling** | One reply per trigger pattern | Sidekick tracks conversation context and tone | **Pilot** |
| **Lead Management** | Basic contact list | Full contact CRM with scoring, tags, stages, sentiment | **Pilot** |
| **Human Handoff** | Mostly manual | HRN system with classifier + risk heuristics | **Pilot** |
| **Pricing Model** | Per-contact scaling | Open-source, self-hostable, predictable model direction | **Pilot** |
| **Shadow Ban Protection** | Manual mitigation | Guardrails-first automation design | **Pilot** |
| **Setup Complexity** | Visual flow builder | Trigger + AI handling | **Pilot** |
| **Open Source** | Closed, vendor lock-in | Fully open-source and forkable | **Pilot** |
| **Multi-Step Sequences** | Supported | Not yet built | **ManyChat** |
| **Visual Flow Builder** | Supported | Not yet built | **ManyChat** |
| **Multi-Channel** | Instagram + FB + WhatsApp + SMS | Instagram-first today | **ManyChat** |
| **Integrations** | 50+ integrations | Early-stage integration surface | **ManyChat** |
